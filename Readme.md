## Abstract

  Considering the medicare expenses in the developed country like US and around the world, it is no more a feasible option to casually consult doctor for first level of uneasiness. Also, in the developing countries like South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya people suffer immensely when it comes to medicare and quick attention required for certain cases. Initial negligence to scenarios like this create immense complications and  might lead to major health issues down the line. There has been a lot of talk about brain tumor and the consequences of its late detection.
  
  According to latest reports it affects around 24000 adults and 3500 children per year in the US alone. One major reason why we are losing people to brain tumor is late detection of the disease. Reports state that an early detection of tumors can save up to 13% . It is unfair to not leverage the technology of our times to develop a solution for this and hence we propose the solution to detect brain tumor in early stage using MRI scans through Artificial intelligence and computer vision.
  
  We plan to develop a supervised Machine learning model by using the brain tumor image dataset. It will train itself to identify the tumorous MRI scans in real time and give out the results on our web application. This project can be extended to detect the presence of Lung cancer using CT scan images of lungs.
