# CMPE 272- Project Ideas

## 1. AI assisted Parking Solution
### Description: To reduce the hassle of parking by using IOT and AI.
### Goal of project: Whenever we go to overflowing parking lot, we face many difficulties in finding a parking lot. Then finally we end up spending so much of our time and energy to find and park the car. When we use the modern IOT systems to keep the lot monitored electronically and storing the data. We can use this data to provide improved service to the person who is parking. Our main goal is to implement an AI communication system(Either voice or chatbot) to communicate with the server and get the current parking data. Keeping this as a base, we can do more valued added things with this data like, showing nearby parking station if all lots in this is full, identify the demand and make the prices dynamic according to the demand. There are plethora of analysis we can do with data and use it.
### Technology stack: IBM Watson(Not finalized), Python, Distance Sensors and controller, Cloud DB(AWS).


## 2. Candidate profile evaluation and segregation
### Description: To reduce the employer's work to manually go through all the profiles of job applicants and segregate them
### Goal of project: In today's world, there might be thousands of applications for a job opening in a company. It gets really tough for the recruitors to go through all the profiles and evaluate them. This process could be very lengthy to filter the evaluated profiles and schedule the interviews for them. Hence, we are coming up with an application which can evaluate the profiles using the inputs provided in the application and segregate them based on the role which best fits for that profile. 
### Technology stack: React JS, Node JS, Express, Mongo DB, ML Algorithms


## 3. Bay area bike share anaylsis
### Description: To reduce the unusability of electric bikes and an effort to show through analysis how can the profit be increased.
### Goal of project: Now a days, electric bikes are being used frequently, but not in all the areas. Bikes are randomly stationed in specific areas. In some areas, there is an abundance of bikes while there is a scarcity in others. Hence, by analysing the past data, we can predict the utilization of electric bikes. Basically, usability is for how long and for how much distance the bike is being used. So, using this data we can determing the locations, where the bikes are frequently used and the places where a great amount of profit can be obtained. In these locations, we can station the bikes. Likewise, using real time data, the bikes stations can be relocated based on the frequency and profit from sales in that area. Also, we can plot these locations using a map api where the bikes which are frequently used are stationed.
### Technology stack: React JS, Node JS, Express, Mongo DB, data analysis tool, ML algorithm like KNN or K-Means clustering
